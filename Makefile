#
#	Makefile for compiling c++ with wiringPi for Raspberry Pi on OSX 10.9 Mavericks
#	https://projects.drogon.net/wiring-pi
#	http://www.jaredwolff.com/blog/cross-compiling-on-mac-osx-for-raspberry-pi/
#
#	This makefile compiles all cpp files in the current folder
#	and creates the executable "App" file in ./bin/
#
#	Compile by typing "make" or "make all"
#	Clean up everything by typing "make clean"
#
#	On the RaspberryPi:
#	start the app by going to the containing folder in terminal and type "sudo App"
#	Exit a running app by typing "Ctrl+c"
#	Stop an app by going to its folder in terminal and typing "sudo killall App"
#	(if "App" is the name of your executable)
